# Web-Scraping with selenium

HTML websites can be scraped using standard python packages such as Requests and BeautifulSoup. However, these methods often fail on websites that were programmed in JAVA, a scripting language that is used to create dynamic web applications.

This project shows what to do when HTML-based web scraping methods fail. Specifically, it uses a special Python module called Selenium which allows the user to initiate a web browser "driver" to navigate a dynamic web application, which can then be scrapped for content.
